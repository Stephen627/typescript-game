# My Game
This project is more about me learning how to use TypeScript in a project, rather than the game that will be the outcome of the project.

## Ideas
    + I really like diablo so I thought making a loot based dungeon crawler would be fun
    + Starting off I want to create 3 classes: Mage, Warrior, and Ranger.
        + The only difference between the classes to begin with will be the weapons they can use
